<h1>Welcome to the AppWorks Platform Extensions</h1>
This extensions package contains the following components that can be used to add value to your AppWorks Platform application:

<h2>Case Timeline View</h2>
<p>This extension provides a graphical timeline view of case events and related time-based entity information, that can be displayed in the Web Content panel of a layout.  The Timeline view can display the following entity data in one or more ‘channels’, along with an indicator of the current date and time:</p>
<div>History - all information from the History Building Block that is not shown in another channel</div>
<div>Tracking - last modified date and deadlines</div>
<div>Lifecycle - task actions and manual state transitions</div>
<div>Discussion - topics and replies</div>
<div>Custom Event - where there is a need to display related time-based entity data in a graphical view</div>

<p>Hovering over an event in the timeline shows a popup with additional details, and the view can be zoomed and scrolled in order to show events that are closely grouped together. </p>
